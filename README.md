# WeatherRanking
Where in Europe should you teleport to experience the best weather possible?

## How do I run this thing?
First, you need docker installed, and also docker-compose. They should do the rest for you. Pun not intended.

**First time?**

`docker-compose up --build`

**Mamma mia, here we go again...**

`docker-compose up`
